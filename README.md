# GameOfLifeMVC
Model-View-Controller Representation of Conway's Game of Life

The game has 3 components; dead cells, live cells, and the rules. 
	The dead cells make up the board in which the game is viewed and are typically referred to as “dead cells”. The cells that make up the unique patterns are “live cells” and they evolve in elaborate patterns according to the same rules:
	
A dead cell with 3 neighbors alive becomes living
A live cell survives if it has either 2 or 3 living neighbors
A live cell with more than 3 or less than 2 neighbors dies


	The game typically starts with a “seed” or initial pattern, which gives way to a multitude of possibilities.
